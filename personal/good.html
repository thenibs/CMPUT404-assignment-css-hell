                        <p>Hello! I am in the 3rd year of my Honors Computing Science degree at the University of Alberta and recently completed a 16-month software engineering internship at IBM on the z/OS Debug team. I truly enjoy solving problems and programming, whether it's for an assignment or for the project at hand.
                            Through my degree and work experience, I seek to challenge myself to the fullest extent academically, personally, and within my chosen field of computing. I have a lot to learn, but I anticipate that my passion and motivation will fuel me forward. I am used to very heavy workloads and have been successful even with 5 courses and 20-30 hours of part time work.</p>
